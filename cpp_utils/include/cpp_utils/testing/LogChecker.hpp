 *
 * In order to automatically check that no warnings nor errors are produced by a test,
 * call \c DEFAULT_LOG_TESTER macro at the beginning of the test.
 * To use specific arguments, use \c INSTANTIATE_LOG_TESTER instead.

 * @brief Instantiate a LogChecker instance that assert that logs has been as expected when runs out of scope.

 * This is an easy way to instantiate a LogChecker by using a unique ptr that autodestroys when exit the scope,
 * and in deletion it is checked that logs has been correct regarding the parameters, and ASSERT if not.
 *
 * @note this is just to avoid the user to write this code. It is needed because ASSERT_TRUE require gtest
 * to be installed and linked, and this could always not be the case.
 *
 * @example
 * TEST(FooTest, test_foo) {
 *   INSTANTIATE_LOG_TESTER(eprosima::utils::Log::Kind::Warning, 0, 0);
 *   // When test finishes, if any log warning has been raised, test will fail.
