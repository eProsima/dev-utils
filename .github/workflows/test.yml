# Main CI for Dev Utils repository
# This is executed with every PullRequest (new or update), any merge in main and every night
#
# These jobs that require to install fastrtps library uses the artifact generated for the nightly job
# so they do not have to compile the whole fastrtps project. This saves huge amount of time.
