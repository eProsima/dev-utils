# ENUMERATION BUILDER

This auto generates the code that would be generated by macro `ENUMERATION_BUILDER` in
`dev-utils/cpp_utils/include/cpp_utils/macros/custom_enumeration.hpp`.

## Motivation

This script is useful because the use of this macro could have problems depending on its use and/or architecture:

- Windows does extend macros in a different order.
- SWIG does not create classes or enums that are extended from a macro.

## Usage

This is a standalone script. In order to execute it:

```sh
python3 enumeration_builder.py --output include/output.hpp --enum CustomEnum --values "value1;value2" --namespaces "eprosima;utils"
```
